# Senior Honours Project

This repository hold the contents of my Senior Honours Project: Data Science Techniques Applied To Cosmology

## Overview
By observing the redshifted 21cm emission line emitted from neutral hydrogen, we can map its structure in 3D and infer the presence of the underlying dark matter density field. 
This structure is rich is cosmological information that helps us understand the history of our Universe.
To obtain this information, the astrophysics foregound which dominates the observations must be removed using signal separation.
A mixture of simulated and real data analysis will be used from the MeerKAT radio telescope and using machine learning techniques such as Gaussian Process Regression.
